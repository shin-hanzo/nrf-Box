> [!NOTE]
> - When using **multiple NRF24** modules, the power demands can exceed the capabilities of the onboard power supply or regulator. Running three NRF modules simultaneously may cause instability, leading to intermittent failures or causing the nRFBox to stop functioning altogether.
> - **Range Limitations**: The jammer is most effective at short range. Beyond a certain distance, the signal weakens, making it harder to consistently disrupt communication.
> - **Device Variability**: Different devices react to jamming signals in varying ways. Some may be more resistant.
